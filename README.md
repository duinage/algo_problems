# algo_problems
Here are some interesting algorithmic problems written by me using Python :)

1. conversion_system.py - conversion system between different number bases;
2. cum_sum.py - cumulative sum of a sequence of numbers;
3. reverse_words_but_same_sentence.py - transform sentence into a sentence with reversed words, same places;
4. Breaking_Caesar's_cipher.py - Caesar cipher encoder/decoder and code breaker that breaks any encrypted message by finding a known word in it;
