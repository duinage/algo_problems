1. conversion_system.py - conversion system between different number bases;
2. cum_sum.py - cumulative sum of a sequence of numbers;
3. reverse_words_but_same_sentence.py - transform sentence into a sentence with reversed words, same places;
4. Memoization_data-type_decorators.py - decorators that implement Memoization and data type checking of the input parameters of the function;
5. sort_bin_array.py - Function sort binary array in linear time without additional memory;
6. qs&ms_analysis.ipynb - QuickSort and MergeSort analysis;
